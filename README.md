# Turtle Graphics Program
The Turtle Graphics program is a Python application that provides a user-friendly interface for controlling a turtle graphics environment. It allows users to interactively draw shapes, create animations, and explore programming concepts in a visual manner.

## Features
Command Shell Interface: Users can enter commands in a command shell interface to control the turtle's movements and actions.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The program includes a GUI built using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly interface for entering commands and interacting with the turtle graphics.
Drawing Commands: Users can issue commands to draw lines, circles, polygons, and other shapes on the screen.
Animation: The program supports simple animations, allowing users to create dynamic visual effects such as bouncing balls.
Educational Tool: It serves as an educational tool for learning programming concepts, particularly for beginners, by visualizing the results of their commands in real-time.

### Code Structure:

The first code is a single Python script that combines the definition of the TurtleShell class, the TurtleApp class, and the main execution block within the same file.
The second code separates the class definitions (TurtleShell and TurtleApp) and the main execution block (if __name__ == '__main__':) into two separate files: Smiley_Face.py and Turtle_GUI.py, respectively.
Purpose:

The first code focuses on providing a complete implementation of the Turtle Graphics program in a single file. It defines the command shell interface (TurtleShell), the GUI (TurtleApp), and the main execution logic in one place.
The second code divides the implementation into separate files, potentially for better organization and modularity. The Smiley_Face.py file may contain additional functionalities or specific features related to drawing a smiley face, while Turtle_GUI.py may handle the overall GUI and interaction logic.
Usage:

The first code is easier to manage and execute as it only requires running a single Python script.
The second code may provide better code organization and separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend the functionality of the program over time.
In summary, both codes achieve similar functionality but differ in their structure and organization. The choice between them depends on factors such as project requirements, code complexity, and personal preference for code organization.
